## About This Site

This site documents my infrastructure lab journey - building, configuring, and troubleshooting enterprise systems for hands-on learning.

## The Lab

I've built a virtualized lab environment featuring:

- **Windows Server 2022** domain controller with Active Directory
- **Windows 11** workstations with Sysmon for enhanced logging
- **Splunk Enterprise** SIEM for centralized log collection
- **Kali Linux** for security testing
- **Docker** containerized services
- **VirtualBox** network segmentation

The goal: gain practical experience with the systems and tools used in real enterprise environments.

## About Me

I'm transitioning into IT with interests in security, cloud, and infrastructure roles. Currently pursuing CompTIA Security+ while building practical skills through this homelab.

Background includes field service work, compliance procedures, and team leadership. Now channeling that experience toward technical IT roles.
