## About This Site

This blog documents my cybersecurity homelab journey - building, breaking, and defending a Windows Active Directory environment for hands-on learning.

## The Lab

I've built a virtualized security lab environment featuring:

- **Windows Server 2022** domain controller with Active Directory
- **Windows 11** workstations with Sysmon for enhanced logging
- **Splunk Enterprise** SIEM for centralized log collection
- **Kali Linux** attack platform for red team exercises

The goal: understand both offensive techniques and defensive detection - the full picture of how attacks work and how to catch them.

## About Me

I'm transitioning into cybersecurity with a focus on SOC analyst and blue team roles. Currently pursuing CompTIA Security+ while building practical skills through this homelab.

Background includes field service work, compliance procedures, and team leadership. Now channeling that experience toward IT security.
